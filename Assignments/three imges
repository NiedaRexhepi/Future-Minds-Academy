    <h1>My Favorite Cities</h1>
    <h2>Dream Destinations: Rome, Paris, and New York</h2>

    <p>
        These are some of the most iconic cities in the world. Each one has its own story, vibe, and charm.
        <br>
        I hope to visit them all one day and experience their unique culture, architecture, and energy.
